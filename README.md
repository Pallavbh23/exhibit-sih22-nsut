<b>Problem Statement Number:</b> DR718 

## Our Product- Exhibit  :fireworks:
### What is Exhibit?
:star2: Our idea revolves around the theme “A place to showcase, collaborate and get inspired”.  

:star2: Exhibit is a platform that welcomes all levels of proficiency across different domains. Any student who has a knack for learning and wants to gain experience by application, or is interested in sharing their projects in a community of people with similar interests is welcome here.

:star2: Exhibit is designed to be a Progressive Web App and aims to be a one-stop solution for all students who want to upskill themselves, showcase their mettle in any domain and look for collaborators!  

:star2: Exhibit can also be helpful in searching for research opportunities. Professors from different universities can put out posts and ask for students to join them on some ongoing research project(s). This would be a major step forward in creating a more inclusive and collaborative research environment. 

### Who is it for?
College students and professors all across the globe! :mortar_board: :earth_americas:
